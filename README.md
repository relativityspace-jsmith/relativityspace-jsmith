- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @relativityspace-jsmith.  This is my work account for stuff I've contributed at my job at Relativity Space!  My personal account is @multiplemonomials.
- I've worked here as an embedded software engineer for the past 3 years.  I primarily work on bare metal code for ARM microprocessors, but also work on some desktop code, such as multicast-expert and netifaces-2.
- As far as programming languages, I'm experienced with C, C++ and Python, and am just starting to learn some Rust as well.
- **Pronouns:** he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Code I've written has now been to space twice!
